% Provide an introductory paragraph that summarizes what's in this section: a list of runs/experiments intended to test your implementation and ideas. Describe each of these experiments in a few words/a sentence.
The Evaluation section presents the experimental setup, performance metrics, and analysis of the ray tracing implementation under various conditions. The computational platform and software environment are detailed to provide context for the hardware and tools used. The methodology outlines the procedures for measuring runtime and calculating speedup, while the results focus on the effects of workload distribution strategies and scene complexity on parallel performance. This section concludes with an analysis of memory usage and its impact on scalability.
