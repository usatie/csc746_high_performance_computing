abstract = {The computing world today is in the middle of a revolution: mobile clients and cloud
computing have emerged as the dominant paradigms driving programming and hardware
innovation today. The Fifth Edition of Computer Architecture focuses on this dramatic
shift, exploring the ways in which software and technology in the "cloud" are accessed
by cell phones, tablets, laptops, and other mobile computing devices. Each chapter
includes two real-world examples, one mobile and one datacenter, to illustrate this
revolutionary change. Updated to cover the mobile computing revolutionEmphasizes the
two most important topics in architecture today: memory hierarchy and parallelism
in all its forms.Develops common themes throughout each chapter: power, performance,
cost, dependability, protection, programming models, and emerging trends ("What's
Next")Includes three review appendices in the printed text. Additional reference appendices
are available online.Includes updated Case Studies and completely new exercises.}
