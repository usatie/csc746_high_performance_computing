% Please take a few moments and try to compose an abstract for your homework writeup. It should contain these ideas: what was the problem being studied, what was the approach (what did you implement), what are the results.
% The abstract should describe the basic message of the paper, including: the problem, why your solution should be of interest, some notion that your solution is effective, and a teaser about how it has been evaluated. Cover all of this using between 75 and 150 words. Thus, the abstract is the hardest part to write. Sometimes I try to write it first, but the final version is usually composed of items drawn from the introduction, and then condensed, as the last step of writing the paper.

% describes the focus of the study, the approach, and the primary findings/results (3 or 4 sentences total). Writing tip: it's often the case that the Abstract and Introduction are the last items written in a technical paper, once you know the outcome of the performance study.

This assignment explores the implementation and performance analysis of the Sobel filter on both CPU and GPU platforms. The Sobel filter, a widely used edge-detection algorithm in image processing, was tested using three parallelization strategies: a CPU-based approach with OpenMP as a CPU baseline, a GPU-optimized approach using CUDA to assess GPU performance, and an OpenMP offload implementation serving as a GPU baseline. Each method was evaluated on the Perlmutter supercomputer, with measurements taken for runtime, achieved occupancy, and memory bandwidth utilization. The results demonstrate CUDAâ€™s superior performance and highlight the highly parallelizable nature of both the GPU architecture and the Sobel filter algorithm.
