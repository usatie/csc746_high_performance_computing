\subsection{CPU with OpenMP Parallelism}
\label{subsec:cpu-omp}
% State the objective for the implementation (2-3 sentences).
This implementation examines CPU parallelization of the Sobel filter using OpenMP, providing a baseline for GPU parallelization. OpenMP directives help distribute computations across multiple threads to improve performance.

% Describe the implementation (2-3 sentences, or more if needed).
The function \texttt{do\_sobel\_filtering()} applies the Sobel filter across the image, as shown in Listing~\ref{listing:sobel-omp}. It iterates over all pixels, calling \texttt{sobel\_filtered\_pixel()} for each one. Adding \texttt{\#pragma omp parallel for} before the outer loop parallelizes row processing, allowing threads to work concurrently on different image rows.

    }
