% Provide an introductory paragraph that summarizes what's in this section: a list of runs/experiments intended to test your implementation and ideas. Describe each of these experiments in a few words/a sentence.

This section presents the results of experiments testing the performance of different implementations of the Sobel filter on CPU and GPU platforms. We begin with an overview of the hardware and software setup on the Perlmutter supercomputer. The experiments measure runtime, achieved occupancy, and memory bandwidth usage. We examine how well the CPU implementation scales with additional threads, then explore different configurations on the GPU to find the best settings for CUDA. Finally, we compare the performance of OpenMP offloading to GPU against the optimal CUDA configuration, highlighting differences in efficiency.
