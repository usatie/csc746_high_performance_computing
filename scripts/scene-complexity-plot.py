"""
Generate a speedup chart for various scene complexities (Objects.size()) from parsed CSV data.

This script:
1. Loads the CSV data (containing Objects.size(), Threads, and Elapsed Time).
2. Filters data for the specified complexities: 8, 1028, 16388.
3. Computes speedup = (Time at 1 thread) / (Time at N threads) for each complexity.
4. Plots these speedups along with an ideal speedup line.

Dependencies: pandas, matplotlib
