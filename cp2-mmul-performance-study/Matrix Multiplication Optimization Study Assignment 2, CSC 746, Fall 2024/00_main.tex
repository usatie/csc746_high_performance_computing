\abstract{
% describes the focus of the study, the approach, and the primary findings/results (3 or 4 sentences total).
The inefficiency of matrix multiplication is due to poor memory and cache utilization, especially as matrix sizes grow.  In this assignment, we implemented Basic Matrix Multiplication (Basic) as an unoptimized baseline, Matrix Multiplication using CBLAS as a highly optimized reference, and Blocked Matrix Multiplication with Copy Optimization (BMMCO) to explore techniques for enhancing spatial and temporal locality. These implementations were evaluated on the Perlmutter supercomputer at NERSC, with performance measured in MFLOP/s. The results demonstrate that BMMCO significantly improves performance over Basic MM by effectively leveraging both spatial and temporal locality, though a performance gap remains compared to CBLAS, suggesting further opportunities for optimization, such as loop reordering and improved in-memory data layout strategies.


% Please take a few moments and try to compose an abstract for your homework writeup. It should contain these ideas: what was the problem being studied, what was the approach (what did you implement), what are the results.
% The abstract should describe the basic message of the paper, including: the problem, why your solution should be of interest, some notion that your solution is effective, and a teaser about how it has been evaluated. Cover all of this using between 75 and 150 words. Thus, the abstract is the hardest part to write. Sometimes I try to write it first, but the final version is usually composed of items drawn from the introduction, and then condensed, as the last step of writing the paper.
