\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}
% Put an introductory paragraph here that gives the reader an overview of what's coming. If there are multiple subsections, say in a few words or a sentence something about each subsection.

% include a separate subsection for each of the different implementations. Briefly describe your implementation, and include the use of compact pseudocode as necessary. The focus here should be on conciseness and clarity. Be sure to describe the strategy you used in parallelizing your code. Your example Listings should clearly indicate the OpenMP pragmas you used. 
This section describes the key components of the distributed-memory Sobel filter implementation. First, we provide an overview of the task distribution and coordination among MPI ranks in the Overall Code Harness (Section~\ref{subsec:overall-code-harness}). Next, we detail the three decomposition strategies employed for dividing the computational domain among ranks: Row-slab, Column-slab, and Tiled decompositions, and how we treated the halo of each tile (Section~\ref{subsec:decomposition-strategies}). Next, we describe efficient data exchange using custom MPI datatypes in the Send and Receive Strided Buffer (Section~\ref{subsec:send-and-receive-strided-buffer}). Finally, the Sobel Implementation (Section~\ref{subsec:sobel-implementation}) explains the application of the Sobel operator for edge detection across distributed data.
