\subsection{Overall Findings and Discussion}
\label{subsec:overall-findings-and-discussion}
% Subsection - overall findings and discussion. Please think about and provide comments, substantiated with the performance data you have collected, on the following issues/questions: How does the amount of data moved vary as a function of grid decomposition strategy? What changes might you make to the overall design of this code to improve the runtime performance of data movement? What might be sources of errors or inaccuracies in how we measure performance (runtime, data movement) in these studies?

The amount of data moved remains relatively consistent across decomposition strategies, likely due to the use of the subarray data type. This approach appears to achieve near-optimal data movement efficiency. To further improve the runtime performance of the Sobel operation, it is recommended to ensure that the grid size of all tiles is as evenly distributed as possible. The current approach, where all tiles have the same size except the last one, can lead to performance bottlenecks, as the overall runtime is constrained by the rank with the longest execution time.

Potential sources of errors or inaccuracies in performance measurement, particularly in runtime and data movement, include the timing methodology employed in rank 0. While using \texttt{MPI\_Barrier} ensures that all ranks complete the preceding code region before proceeding, it does not guarantee synchronization in the actual execution of subsequent operations across all ranks. This lack of strict synchronization may lead to discrepancies in the recorded execution times.
