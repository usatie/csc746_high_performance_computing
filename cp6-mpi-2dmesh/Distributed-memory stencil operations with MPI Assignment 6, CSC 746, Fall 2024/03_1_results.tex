% Provide an introductory paragraph that summarizes what's in this section: a list of runs/experiments intended to test your implementation and ideas. Describe each of these experiments in a few words/a sentence.

In this section, we analyze how our distributed-memory implementation of the Sobel filter improves computational efficiency by leveraging parallel execution across multiple CPU nodes. We evaluate the performance of three grid decomposition strategies—Column-slab, Row-slab, and Tiled—under various concurrency levels. We start by describing the computational platform and software environment we used for our experiments. Next, we explain our methodology, including decomposition techniques, runtime measurement, data movement tracking, and speedups to assess parallel performance. Through our runtime performance and data movement studies, we identify how task distribution, communication, and synchronization influence overall efficiency. Finally, we discuss our findings and suggest optimizations to enhance scalability and performance accuracy.
