% Provide an introductory paragraph that summarizes what's in this section: a list of runs/experiments intended to test your implementation and ideas. Describe each of these experiments in a few words/a sentence.

In this section, we present a series of experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of three matrix multiplication (MM) methods: Basic, BMMCO, and CBLAS. The experiments used matrix sizes of \(128 \times 128\), \(512 \times 512\), and \(2048 \times 2048\). For the Basic and Blocked OpenMP (Parallel) implementations, we tested with thread counts of 1, 4, 16, and 64 to assess the impact of parallelism and thread utilization. These experiments aim to measure the performance gains from cache optimization and parallelism. By analyzing hardware counter values for L2 and L3 cache accesses, we explore the cache efficiency of each method. Additionally, by evaluating the speedup achieved through parallelism for Basic and BMMCO, we investigate potential issues related to thread underutilization.
