% Put an introductory paragraph here that gives the reader an overview of what's coming. If there are multiple subsections, say in a few words or a sentence something about each subsection.

% include a separate subsection for each of the different implementations. Briefly describe your implementation, and include the use of compact pseudocode as necessary. The focus here should be on conciseness and clarity. Be sure to describe the strategy you used in parallelizing your code. Your example Listings should clearly indicate the OpenMP pragmas you used. 

This section presents three MM implementations aimed at evaluating performance improvements through parallelization and optimization techniques. The first implementation, Basic OMP, evaluates the impact of adding shared-memory parallelism to a simple MM approach. The second, Blocked Matrix Multiplication with Copy Optimization (BMMCO), combines cache optimization techniques with parallelization to further enhance computational efficiency. Finally, the CBLAS MM serves as a baseline, using a highly optimized but serial implementation.

Each subsection details the objectives, describes the applied techniques, and presents compact pseudocode or listings to illustrate the use of OpenMP and optimization strategies.
